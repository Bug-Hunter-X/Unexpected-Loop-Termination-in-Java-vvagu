This repository contains a simple Java program that exhibits an uncommon coding error involving unexpected loop termination. The `bug.java` file demonstrates the flawed code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version with improved clarity regarding the loop's termination condition.  The bug is subtle; it involves a `break` statement inside an `if` condition within the loop, making it easy to overlook the exact point where the loop might terminate earlier than expected. The solution addresses this by using a more explicitly defined loop condition, or alternative approaches that avoid early loop terminations.
